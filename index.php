						<p class ="shrink_para">
                            I was looking to create a website for my business but wasn’t sure how to start or what to even do. I was lucky enough to know Mike and know that he is very talented in computer programming. I showed him an example of a website I liked and he went above and beyond! Mike walked me through the whole process and was communicative the entire time. Mike set me up with the proper domain; told me exactly where to go and how to do it. I sent him my pictures and information I wanted to convey about my business. He took his time to look over my content and give me awesome feedback about what will work with a Mobile App as well as Desktop. Something I really wanted was a pop out window that gives the customer the ability to email me directly. I thought this was a big feature I was asking for but Mike made it happen! After my site was launched, I’ve seen a greater increase in activity on my social platforms and also have received great feedback from my customers about my site; it is fun and easy to navigate. Mike is amazing and very professional with a hundred percent focus on the customer. I definitely recommend Mike to anyone that is looking to create a website for their brand! 
                            Thanks again Mike!

							Displaying a long list of items on a web page, like a list of 200 movie titles or 400 products, can overwhelm a user with too much information at once. A common solution is to display a handful of items on one page and provide navigation to jump to a list of more items. In this project, I wrote JavaScript to divide a long list into a series of "pages" and improve the user experience of the web page.
